# this is the code for the use case 2.
# this use case takes advantage of the following items
# 1) the DMP (No. XXX)
# 2) the FIP (Name of FIP)


# Step 1 load both of them: one Turtle file.
# load DMP112581_converted.ttl


# Step 2: create a mapping between the DMP and the FIP.

# 


# load the general network - one Turtle file.

# expected output is that I have a question in DMP,
# and the output is how many entities/parties are going to have an impact. And how.


# Take for example, Q3.2 in a DMP (using DMP tempalte 1.7) specified above.
